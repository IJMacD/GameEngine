This method ensures that each component added will have a chance to update once per frame for this object. Parameters: Name Type Description component GameComponent The component to be added to this object Inherited From: GameObject#addComponent Returns: Returns a reference to this for chainability Type GameObject &lt;abstract&gt; init(parent) This method is called once when the component is first added to each parent. Use this to perform set-up and add any necessary properties to parent objects. Parameters: Name Type Description parent GameObject A reference to the GameObject on which this component is operating. This allows multiple GameObjects to share stateless components. Inherited From: GameComponent#init removeComponent(component) Remove a particular GameComponent which had previously been added to this object. Parameters: Name Type Description component GameComponent The component to be removed from this object Inherited From: GameObject#removeComponent Returns: Returns a reference to this for chainability Type GameObject setPosition(x, y, z) Protective method to set position of the object in world-units. The native units are world-units. i.e. If a 2D camera is used with the scale set to 1x and the canvas is not scaled in the webpage, 1 unit in the world will equate to 1 pixel on the screen. This method will preserve position on axes which you leave undefined in the call to this method. Parameters: Name Type Description x number x component of position vector y number y component of position vector z number z component of position vector Inherited From: GameObject#setPosition Returns: Returns a reference to this for chainability Type GameObject Example This will only affect the y co-ordinate, leaving x and z at their original values. // Set y = 20 gameObject.setPosition(undefined, 20); setVelocity(x, y, z) Protective method to set velocity of the object. The native units are world-units per millisecond. i.e. If a 2D camera is used with the scale set to 1x and the canvas is not scaled in the webpage, 1 unit in the world will equate to 1 pixel on the screen. In this common case the units of velocity will be equivelant to pixels-per-millisecond. This method will preserve position on axes which you leave undefined in the call to this method. Parameters: Name Type Description x number x component of velocity vector y number y component of velocity vector z number z component of velocity vector Inherited From: GameObject#setVelocity Returns: Returns a reference to this for chainability Type GameObject Example This will only affect the velocity parallel to the y-axis co-ordinate, leaving vx and vz unaffected. // Set vy = 20px per second gameObject.setVelocity(undefined, 0.02); toHTML() This method is used to produce a html representation of the component for things such as debugging trees.

Parameters: Name Type Description component GameComponent The component to be added to this object Inherited From: GameObject#addComponent Returns: Returns a reference to this for chainability Type GameObject &lt;abstract&gt; init(parent) This method is called once when the component is first added to each parent.

Parameters: Name Type Description component GameComponent The component to be removed from this object Inherited From: GameObject#removeComponent Returns: Returns a reference to this for chainability Type GameObject setBounds(bounds) Set the bounds of this world. Parameters: Name Type Description bounds array Array containing co-ordinates specifying the world [minX, minY, maxX, maxY, minZ, maxZ] setPosition(x, y, z) Protective method to set position of the object in world-units. The native units are world-units. i.e. If a 2D camera is used with the scale set to 1x and the canvas is not scaled in the webpage, 1 unit in the world will equate to 1 pixel on the screen. This method will preserve position on axes which you leave undefined in the call to this method. Parameters: Name Type Description x number x component of position vector y number y component of position vector z number z component of position vector Inherited From: GameObject#setPosition Returns: Returns a reference to this for chainability Type GameObject Example This will only affect the y co-ordinate, leaving x and z at their original values. // Set y = 20 gameObject.setPosition(undefined, 20); setVelocity(x, y, z) Protective method to set velocity of the object. The native units are world-units per millisecond. i.e. If a 2D camera is used with the scale set to 1x and the canvas is not scaled in the webpage, 1 unit in the world will equate to 1 pixel on the screen. In this common case the units of velocity will be equivelant to pixels-per-millisecond. This method will preserve position on axes which you leave undefined in the call to this method. Parameters: Name Type Description x number x component of velocity vector y number y component of velocity vector z number z component of velocity vector Inherited From: GameObject#setVelocity Returns: Returns a reference to this for chainability Type GameObject Example This will only affect the velocity parallel to the y-axis co-ordinate, leaving vx and vz unaffected. // Set vy = 20px per second gameObject.setVelocity(undefined, 0.02); toHTML() This method is used to produce a html representation of the object for things such as debugging trees. It will include components in its rendering. Similar to the toString method. Inherited From: GameObject#toHTML Returns: Representation of this component in HTML Type string update(delta) This method is called once per frame. GameObjects will usually only need to call update on each of its components in this method passing a reference to itself. Parameters: Name Type Description delta number Time since last frame in milliseconds Inherited From: GameObject#update × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.4.3 on 2017-01-31T19:40:18+08:00 using the DocStrap template.

WorldWrapComponent When parent goes outside of world bounds wrap to the opposite wall. new WorldWrapComponent(worldSystem) Parameters: Name Type Description worldSystem WorldSystem Which world is the parent in. Extends GameComponent Members components :array Array of components which update this GameObject. Type: array Inherited From: GameObject#components life :number Integer representing the number of lives remaining for this object. Type: number Inherited From: GameObject#life position :vec3 Position of this object in the world. Type: vec3 Inherited From: GameObject#position rotation :number Current rotation of this object. Type: number Inherited From: GameObject#rotation rotationSpeed :number Current speed of rotation. Type: number Inherited From: GameObject#rotationSpeed team :number Integer representing the team this object belongs to. Type: number Inherited From: GameObject#team velocity :vec3 Velocity of this object moving through the world. Type: vec3 Inherited From: GameObject#velocity Methods addComponent(component) This method is used to add a GameComponent to this object. GameComponents give objects particular behaviours. This method ensures that each component added will have a chance to update once per frame for this object. Parameters: Name Type Description component GameComponent The component to be added to this object Inherited From: GameObject#addComponent Returns: Returns a reference to this for chainability Type GameObject &lt;abstract&gt; init(parent) This method is called once when the component is first added to each parent. Use this to perform set-up and add any necessary properties to parent objects. Parameters: Name Type Description parent GameObject A reference to the GameObject on which this component is operating. This allows multiple GameObjects to share stateless components. Inherited From: GameComponent#init removeComponent(component) Remove a particular GameComponent which had previously been added to this object. Parameters: Name Type Description component GameComponent The component to be removed from this object Inherited From: GameObject#removeComponent Returns: Returns a reference to this for chainability Type GameObject setPosition(x, y, z) Protective method to set position of the object in world-units. The native units are world-units. i.e. If a 2D camera is used with the scale set to 1x and the canvas is not scaled in the webpage, 1 unit in the world will equate to 1 pixel on the screen.
